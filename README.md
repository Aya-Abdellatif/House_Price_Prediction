# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, and location using machine learning algorithms like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build and compare two different models for predicting house prices:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple, interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable (house price).
- **Random Forest**: A more complex, ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and handle non-linear relationships.

# Results

- **Linear Regression**: Achieved an R-squared score of 0.66 and RMSE of $67,227.03.
- **Random Forest**: Achieved an R-squared score of 0.85 and RMSE of $35,000.

### Model Comparison
- The **Random Forest** model performs better overall due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- The **Linear Regression** model is simpler and faster, but has limitations when dealing with complex datasets.
